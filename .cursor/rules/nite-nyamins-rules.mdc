## UI Components
This project uses @gluestack components as atomic components to build custom components. 
Default to using Gluestack components, but if it is not possible or unfeasible, create components using regular React Native.

## Testing
Favor using React functional components, and write components that are unit-testable

This project uses @testing-library/react-native and Jest.
When writing tests use the BDD pattern to describe what the tests does. Use comments such as.
```
// Given: I have 2 numbers
const a = 1
const b = 2

// When: I add them
const ans = sum(a, b)

// Then: the sum should be correct
expect(ans).toBeEqual(3)
```

## Addtional Packages
This project uses the React Native MapBox package for displaying maps. When using RNMapBox, consult the documentation to ensure we're using correct syntax.

## Documentation
Add Typescript documentation to all important functions
